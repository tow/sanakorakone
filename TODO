Scoring system: keep score by type, tense, negativeness, person. Show this to highlight any weak points.
(later: also do this by weak/strong mutation to capture problems there also)

DONE in case of a failure, put in a letter-by-letter diff

allow excluding irregular verbs
allow choosing verbs with weak/strong variations.

don't send out examples with "---" for generated verb



SCORES:
I want to be able to know, for each tuple of
(verbtype, tense, negation, person)
 what my score is.
I also want to be able to sum that up over at least verbtype and tense.
I want to see this as an overall score that I can drill down into.
For the score I want to see %age and also numbers
It should be maintained within the context of the session and also maybe stored in localcache.
